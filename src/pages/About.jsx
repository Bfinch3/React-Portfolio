        For 7 years I was a tier 3 help desk, Systems Administrator and Network
        Administrator. In my time in this position I have worked for small
        locally owned break fix shops and larger corporations like
        Creditcards.com, Whole Foods and RedVentures. I am married to a QA
        developer that always makes me strive to be better and is constantly
        judging my code. Software development is something I have always aspired
        to do because I like problem solving and being creative. My goal after
        bootcamp is to find a Jr. dev position.
